Designing algorithms requires 
1) Techniques - data structures / dynamic programming / depth-first / backtracking ...
2) Resources - starting points / similar problems with their solutions

#### Recursive objects
- Permutations
- Subsets
- Trees
- Graphs
- Points
- Polygons
- Strings

Model the problem correctly before trying to solve it!

# Complexity
Worst case complexity is the most useful measure in practice than Best/Average (Average is often hard to define)

### RAM model
Random Access Machine - used to model complexity of a solution. A simplified model of how computations are executed.
- 1 step = *simple ops* (+, -, *, if, function call) Or *memory access*
- n steps = Loops / subroutines
